Python is a very fun language to learn. I haven't learned too much, but I know how certain functions work or variables, like how a calling in on a function. Calling on a function pretty much just runs the code attached to it. I'm pretty much just self-taught. I think it's challenging to code when you have to remember how certain functions work, but that's nothing a refresher can't fix.

I think what went wrong was how it was intructed. The intructions on their own weren't too clear and I could see where some kids would struggle finding where things were considering the layout of this app/website. I think my only challenge was just creating the journal and accessing it. A way you could probably show how to do this better is by explaining where certain locations on Github is paired with screenshots of the layout with captions explaining what was going on in the picture.

Using my computer for school work is one time where computer science comes into play. The computer science aspect comes into play when I use different website or pick different apps. Like when I use Google and search up something like Wikipedia, the program on Google will search for matching results based on what the input states. Then you click on the link, and the code in the search engine leads you to the website.

The job that I researched was the job of video game designer. The main responsiblities/tasks for this career path is formulating characters, creating the plot, giving characters a backstory or interesting traits, creating settings, etc. They must be able to code and assist with testing the software for things like bugds, glitches, and general user-friendly interfacing. A person needs at least a bachelor's degree in software engineering or some realted field of study. You get to strengthen your fluency in coding and get an opportunity to flex your creative muscles. I have an active imagination and have an interest in video games, so I think this job aligns with my passions because I have a love for coding, video games, and creating interesting stories and the like.

I discovered that they've been testing augmented reality on creatures like bugs. I believe they've been doing it to improve augmented reality technology as well as researching animal behaviors.
