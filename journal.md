Python is a very fun language to learn. I haven't learned too much, but I know how certain functions work or variables, like how a calling in on a function. Calling on a function pretty much just runs the code attached to it. I'm pretty much just self-taught. I think it's challenging to code when you have to remember how certain functions work, but that's nothing a refresher can't fix.

I think what went wrong was how it was intructed. The intructions on their own weren't too clear and I could see where some kids would struggle finding where things were considering the layout of this app/website. I think my only challenge was just creating the journal and accessing it. A way you could probably show how to do this better is by explaining where certain locations on Github is paired with screenshots of the layout with captions explaining what was going on in the picture.

Using my computer for school work is one time where computer science comes into play. The computer science aspect comes into play when I use different website or pick different apps. Like when I use Google and search up something like Wikipedia, the program on Google will search for matching results based on what the input states. Then you click on the link, and the code in the search engine leads you to the website.
