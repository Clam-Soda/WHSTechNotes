I set up my journal :D !
# September 12th, 2024
I think what went wrong was how it was intructed. The intructions on their own weren't too clear and I could see where some kids would struggle finding where things were considering the layout of this app/website. I think my only challenge was just creating the journal and accessing it. A way you could probably show how to do this better is by explaining where certain locations on Github is paired with screenshots of the layout with captions explaining what was going on in the picture.
