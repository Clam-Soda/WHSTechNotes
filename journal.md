I set up my journal :D !

Python is a very fun language to learn. I haven't learned too much, but I know how certain functions work or variables, like how a calling in on a function. Calling on a function pretty much just runs the code attached to it. I'm pretty much just self-taught. I think it's challenging to code when you have to remember how certain functions work, but that's nothing a refresher can't fix.

I think what went wrong was how it was intructed. The intructions on their own weren't too clear and I could see where some kids would struggle finding where things were considering the layout of this app/website. I think my only challenge was just creating the journal and accessing it. A way you could probably show how to do this better is by explaining where certain locations on Github is paired with screenshots of the layout with captions explaining what was going on in the picture.

It's a free week.

Using my computer for school work is one time where computer science comes into play. The computer science aspect comes into play when I use different website or pick different apps. Like when I use Google and search up something like Wikipedia, the program on Google will search for matching results based on what the input states. Then you click on the link, and the code in the search engine leads you to the website.

The job that I researched was the job of video game designer. The main responsiblities/tasks for this career path is formulating characters, creating the plot, giving characters a backstory or interesting traits, creating settings, etc. They must be able to code and assist with testing the software for things like bugds, glitches, and general user-friendly interfacing. A person needs at least a bachelor's degree in software engineering or some realted field of study. You get to strengthen your fluency in coding and get an opportunity to flex your creative muscles. I have an active imagination and have an interest in video games, so I think this job aligns with my passions because I have a love for coding, video games, and creating interesting stories and the like.

I discovered that they've been testing augmented reality on creatures like bugs. I believe they've been doing it to improve augmented reality technology as well as researching animal behaviors.

1. I mostly enjoy how calm this class is uually, but the people in here are usually pretty interesting to hang around. Plus my friends are in here, so it makes it more bearable. I wouldn't say a lot would need improvement aside from maybe noise levels in case kids (like me) have nois sensitivity? Other than that, the low lighting is great for ligth sensitivity and helps keeps the room pretty calm and relaxed feeling.
2. I'd probably want to work on game mechanics or just text based games? Or perhaps something similar to pokemon? Something like that.
3. I wouldn't say it'd be interest in anything computer science related, but I think it'd be cool to do in my free-time or as a hobby of sorts.

I learned about some of Donald Trump's executive orders from a comedian on YouTube, and also learned that Kendrick Lamar preform during halftime at the Super Bowl. I also learned some French on Duolingo for the last 18 days, including today. It's been real fun to learn the pronunciation and spelling conventions, amongst other things about it :D !!

I'm very much ready for the summer. Honestly, I'm hoping I get time to relax and hang out with my friends rather than worry about school.

My thoughts on the cell phone law are mostly 50/50, as I can see both sides. I'm personally somewhat adjusted to the cell phone ban, but I'm a little upset that some teacher's I see use their phone while the students can't. Other difficulties I've seen have been not being able to use phone for things that specifically used to call for phones (like QR codes). The point of the law was to boost of the grades in the state, which I can understand, but shouldn't that mostly be up to the parents to enforce this to their kids instead of making the schools do it? I want to say it's a little flawed, but I'm not exactly the guys who agreed to pass this state law in Texas, so. However, I do feel like the law within schools should be a bit more lenient, with letting phones during lunch and passing period, as those aren't *active* learning hours and moreso free periods. Perhaps also letting kids use ohones for *music* and whatever intructional use the teacher states, since a lot of the reason kids have phones or headphones on are for music, apart from the ones who use it to text during class. I'm not really counting those ones. The law has gotten kids to focus and socialize, but it doesn't seem entirely that fair, in my opinion.
